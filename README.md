# Challenge-C--Practice-OPP-in-C-
Turn-based game with 6 rooms, each holding a random monster. The player (HP 100, ATK 10) fights through them one by one. Player attacks first; if the monster survives, it counterattacks. Combat repeats until one dies. Clear all rooms to win; if the player dies at any point, the game ends.
